# Bees-Algorithm-Parallel-Machine-Scheduling
Dataset and results for Parallel Machine Scheduling
presented at the International Workshop on the Bees Algorithm and its Applications (BAA), online, 13th November 2024. 

If you use the generated datasets with n=100 and m=6,7,8,9,10, and compare the resuts, please cite our publication:
Y. Muharni and N. Hartono, "Bees Algorithm in Parallel Machine Scheduling: A Comparative Study", in press - the name will be updated after publication

Results: BA = Bees Algorithm, BAF = Fibonacci Bees Algorithm, GA = Genetic Algorithm, SA = Simulated Annealing

The benchmark instances are based on the dataset from Tanaka et al. with number of task, n =20 and number of machine (m = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
We generate the instance datasets for a sample size of 100 with m = 6,7,8,9,10 using the equation provided in Tanaka et al.
